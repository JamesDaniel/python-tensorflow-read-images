# Final Year Project Preliminary work

## Goals
- 1. read in images
- 2. read mnist handwritten data and save to .tfrecords file
- 3. read in images with labels
- 4. read in images and save as tensor
- 5. read in images and save to .tfrecords file
- 6. read from .tfrecords file
- 7. change data from .tfrecords into tensor

## Goals accomplished
- 1. Done with test.py
- 2. Done with mnist_to_record.py
